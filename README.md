# Cryptopedia - The Cryptocurrency Information Hub

This project is a submission for Hack This Fall 2.0 Hackathon, under the theme of "Blockchain and Crypto"

## What does Cryptopedia do?

There is always a great deal of research involved when a person wishes to trade cryptocurrencies. There are several websites available on the internet which can show News, Crypto Stats, current market prices, but for doing this one has to visit different websites to obtain different informations.

Cryptopedia uses APIs like Coinranking and Newsdata to display a short crypto summary, the latest price of each cryptocurrency, latest crypto news to keep the reader updated about the crypto world, and provides a list of Exchanges where cryptocurrencies are traded so that the investors/traders can decide where to buy and sell crypto, all at the same place, helping them reduce the time they spend on research

# Deployment [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/42076a81-1471-4b9f-b659-67600ab2d522/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/focused-kepler-ff46de/deploys)

**Cryptopedia** has been deployed on Netlify, and can be viewed [here](https://focused-kepler-ff46de.netlify.app/), however the website is down currently.

## Challenges we ran into

Since our project is largely based on APIs, the first step was to find suitable APIs for this project. There are some APIs that are free while others are paid. Further, there were some APIs that only respond with success when we are in development mode (_localhost:3000 for the win_) and not in production mode.
Apart from that, the more we made changes to the codebase, the page reloaded again and again, which at times made us reach the API Limits, delaying our code completion.

Nevertheless, the journey was very amazing
